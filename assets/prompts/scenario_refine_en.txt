Convert the following script into a dedicated XML format for TTS generation in 'en'.

# Input Data (JSON sequence):
{input_json}

# Output Format (XML):
<script>
    <speaker1>Content</speaker1>
    <speaker2>Content</speaker2>
    <speaker3>Content</speaker3>
    ...
</script>

# STRICT RULES:
1. **Transliteration**: Convert any Numbers or Symbols into their full spoken English form (e.g. 100 -> one hundred).
   Examples:
    - '100' -> 'one hundred'
    - 'No.1' -> 'number one'
    - '&' -> 'and'

2. **Preservation**: **CRITICAL**: Do NOT summarize, verify, or change the meaning. Do NOT change any other words. Keep the meaning and structure exactly identical.
3. **Structure**: Use the exact 'tag' provided in input as the XML tag name.

Output ONLY the raw XML string. No markdown code blocks.
